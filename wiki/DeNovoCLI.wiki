=DeNovoGUI Command Line Interface=

The command line interface to DeNovoGUI, referred to as DeNovoCLI, makes is easy to use DeNovoGUI in a command line setting, for example as part of a bigger software pipeline.

DeNovoCLI takes a set of spectrum files as input and uses the [http://proteomics.ucsd.edu/Software/PepNovo.html PepNovo+],  [http://fenchurch.mc.vanderbilt.edu/bumbershoot/directag/ DirecTag] and [http://pfind.ict.ac.cn/software/pNovo/ pNovo+] (beta) algorithms to de novo sequence each spectrum according to the given search parameters.

Note that the spectra must be provided in the Mascot Generic File (mgf) format.

The recommended way to generate an identification parameters file is via the DeNovoGUI graphical user interface. But the file can also be created using the [http://code.google.com/p/compomics-utilities/wiki/IdentificationParametersCLI IdentificationParametersCLI]. 

*General command line:*

{{{
java -cp DeNovoGUI-X.Y.Z.jar com.compomics.denovogui.cmd.DeNovoCLI [parameters]
}}}

*Mandatory parameters:*

{{{
-spectrum_files	        Spectrum files (mgf format), comma separated list or an entire folder.
                        Example: "file1.mgf, file2.mgf".

-output_folder		The output folder.

-id_params	        A search parameters file. Generated from the GUI 
                        or using the IdentificationParametersCLI.
}}}

*Optional common parameters:*

{{{
-pepnovo                Turn the PepNovo+ sequencing on or off. 
                        (1: on, 0: off, default is '1')

-directag               Turn the DirecTag sequencing on or off. 
                        (1: on, 0: off, default is '1')

-pnovo                  Turn the pNovo+ sequencing on or off.
                        (1: on, 0: off, default is '0') 
}}}


*Optional advanced parameters:*

{{{
-pep_novo_folder        The folder where PepNovo+ is installed. 
                        Defaults to the version provided with DeNovoGUI.

-directag_folder        The folder where DirecTag is installed. 
                        Defaults to the version provided with DeNovoGUI.

-pnovo_folder           The folder where pNovo+ is installed. 
                        Defaults to the version provided with DeNovoGUI.

-threads                The number of threads to use for the processing. 
                        Default is the number of cores available.
}}}

==Comma Separated List==

When using comma separated lists as input for the mgf files or the PTMs, please pay attention to the quotes required. Surround the full content of the option in quotes and not the individual items:

{{{
-spectrum_files "C:\..\file_1.mgf, C:\..\file_2.mgf"

-variable_mods "oxidation of m, phosphorylation of s"
}}}

==Examples==

Here is an example for Windows using a search parameters file. _X_, _Y_ and _Z_ have to be replaced by the actual version of DeNovoGUI and _my folder_ by the folder containing the desired files:

{{{
java -cp DeNovoGUI-X.Y.Z.jar com.compomics.denovogui.cmd.DeNovoCLI 
-spectrum_files "C:/my_folder" 
-output_folder "C:/my_folder/output"
-search_params "C:/my_folder/DeNovoGUI.parameters" 
}}}

_Note that for readability the commands are here split over multiple lines. When used the commands should of course be single lines._
