        <p align="justify">
        <H3>Enzyme</H3>
        Currently, only TRYPSIN as default is supported.
        <br><br>

        <H3>Fragment Mass Tolerance</H3>
        The fragment mass tolerance can be set between 0 and 0.75 Da.
        <br><br>

        <H3>Precursor Mass Tolerance</H3>
        The precursor mass tolerance can be set between 0 and 5.0 Da.
        <br><br>

        <H3>No. Solutions</H3>
        This parameter presents the number of possible peptide suggestions for each spectrum (1-20).
        The default setting is 20 solutions.
        <br><br>

        <H3>No. Threads/Cores</H3>
        The number of threads is given by the number of available CPU cores by default.
        This parameter is important to speed up the de novo sequencing.
        <br><br>

        <H3>Model</H3>
        The currently only available default model is CID_IT_TRYP. Please contact the developers of PepNovo+
        for other model support.
        <br><br>

        <H3>Use Spectrum Charge</H3>
        When activated, the given spectrum charge is used and no correction for the spectrum charge is executed.
        This setting is disabled by default.
        <br><br>

        <H3>Use Spectrum Precursor m/z</H3>
        When activated, the given spectrum precursor m/z is used and no correction for the spectrum precursor m/z is executed.
        This setting is disabled by default.
        <br><br>

        <H3>Filter Low Quality Spectra</H3>
        This options filters our low quality spectra and speeds up the de novo sequencing process.
        This setting is enabled by default.
        <br><br>

    </p>
    <H3>Modifications</H3>

    <p align="justify">
        There are two types of modifications, fixed and variable. Fixed modifications will 
        be added to every residue that can be modified by the given modification, while the variable modifications 
        are sometimes added and sometimes not. Which type to choose depends on your experimental setup.
        <br><br>
        You can add multiple modifications of each type, but remember that the more variable modifications you 
        add the more complex the search becomes which increases the risk of false positives.
        <br><br>
        Initially only the most used modifications are shown. To show all modifications simply select 'All 
        Modifications' in the drop down menu above the list of modifications. Here you can also see more 
        details about each modification.
