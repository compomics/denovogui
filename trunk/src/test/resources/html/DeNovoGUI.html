        <b>DeNovoGUI</b> is a software for automated <i>de novo</i> peptide sequencing of MS/MS spectra and tag-based protein identification searching.
        <br><br>
        As a first step the software uses the <a href="http://www.thegpm.org/TANDEM/">PepNovo+</a> algorithm for the <i>de novo</i> peptide sequencing.
            <br><br>
            When starting the application five main tabs can be found:
            <ol>
                <li><b>De Novo Search:</b> In this view the input MS/MS spectra can be selected. Supported input format is MGF.
                    In the next panel the executable of the PepNovo+ algorithm must be selected. Finally, the output folder must be specified.
                    On the right side several search settings for the <i>de novo</i> peptide sequencing can be chosen as well as modifications.
                    When clicking on the Start button on the De Novo Search Run panel, the <i>de novo</i> peptide sequencing will be initiated.
                    The Logging panel provides information about the processing status.
                </li><br>
                <li><b>De Novo Results:</b> The MS/MS spectrum is displayed with ion annotations derived from the <i>de novo</i> sequencing.
                    In the bottom left corner the query spectra are provided in the table. When clicking on one of the rows a spectrum can be selected.
                    The bottom right side displays a table with all <i>de novo</i> hits for a selected spectrum. It also provides information from
                    <i>de novo</i> algorithm such as score, N-terminal and C-terminal gap masses.
                    Note that the Statistics tab (see below) provides useful information about the score distribution.
                </li><br>
                <li><b>Tag-DB Search:</b> In the top left panel a protein FASTA database file must be specified to match the derived tags against.
                    In the top right panel the search settings for the tag-based database search can be changed.
                    When clicking on the Start button on the Tag-DB Search Run panel, the <i>de novo</i> peptide sequencing will be initiated.
                    The Logging panel provides information about the processing status.
                    Note that for the FASTA database only the UniProt (SwissProt/Trembl) format is currently support in <b>DeNovoGUI</b>.
                </li><br>
                <li><b>Tag-DB Search Results:</b> In the top left panel the protein families are displayed in the table.
                    The corresponding protein, peptides and PSMs can be found in the other tables. The spectrum with ion and amino acid
                    annotations is displayed in the bottom right corner.</li><br>
                <li><b>Statistics:</b> This view provided a histogram of the <i>de novo</i> scores based on all input MS/MS spectra.
                    It is supposed to be a quality measure for the input data.
                </li>
            </ol>
            All derived result from the tag-based database search can be exported via the Export menu. It is possible to export all proteins, peptides or peptide-spectrum-matches (PSMs).
