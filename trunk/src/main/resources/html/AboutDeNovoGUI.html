        DeNovoGUI provides an easy to use graphical front end to the <a href="http://proteomics.ucsd.edu/Software/PepNovo.html">PepNovo+</a> 
        algorithm for the <i>de novo</i> sequencing of MS/MS spectra.
        <br><br>
        The software is being developed by Thilo Muth, Marc Vaudel and Harald Barsnes.

        <H2>Example Dataset</H2>
        DeNovoGUI includes a realistic example of a plant proteomics datasets. It consists of 30,289 MS/MS 
        spectra from an <i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i> whole leaf proteome. The obtained tryptic peptides were separated via ion-pair 
        reversed-phase high-performance liquid chromatography and were measured on an LTQ Orbitrap XL mass spectrometer using high-resolution 
        precursor ion selection followed by CID fragmentation.
        <br><br>
