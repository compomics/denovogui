        <h3>Show All Peaks</h3>
        <p align="justify">
            As a default only the peaks currently annotated 
            by a fragment ion is shown in the foreground. The other peaks are shown 
            in grey in the background. Only (red) peaks in the foreground can be selected. 
            To move all peaks to the foreground click the <i>Show All Peaks</i> option in 
            the menu below the spectrum.

        <h3>Annotation</h3>
        <p align="justify">
            <b>DeNovoGUI</b> automatically annotates the a spectrum with the 
            most likely ions given the spectrum and the peptide sequence identified. 
            This includes the automatic selection of neutral losses. 
            <br><br>
            However, the user can override the default annotation by selecting 
            different ion types in the menu below the spectrum. To change the neutral 
            losses one first has to uncheck the <i>Adapt</i> option on the <i>Loss</i> menu. 
            <br><br>
            To make sure that the same ion types are used for all spectra, the user 
            can also turn of the automatic annotation completely in the <i>Settings</i> 
            menu.
            <br><br>
            Note that the spectrum annotation is relative to the sequenced peptide, even 
            if the de novo sequencing contains gaps at the terminals. In other words y1 
            is not always strictly speaking y1, but can be y1 + the mass of the gap. If 
            there is a gap it is annotated in peptide sequence by '...' as the terminal 
            at the respective terminal, and the mass of the gap is listed in the N-Gap 
            and C-Gap columns in the De Novo Peptides table.

        <h3>Zooming</h3>
        <p align="justify">
            Zooming is achieved by clicking and holding the left mouse
            button where you want to start the zoom, and then drag in
            the direction you want to zoom, marking the area to be
            zoomed. Right clicking in the plot undos the zoom.

        <h3>De Novo Sequencing</h3>
        <p align="justify">
            In <b>DeNovoGUI</b> there are two ways of doing de novo sequencing: manual or automatic.
            <br><br>
            <i>Manual:</i> Click on one peak. The distance
            and amino acids matching this distance (if any) will then
            be shown. To add the sequence, click on the second peak.
            Repeat the process to sequence more peaks. 
            <br><br>
            An added sequence is removed by holding down the Ctrl button when clicking on
            the sequence. To "store" a sequence, hold down the Alt button
            and click on the sequence, the sequence turns red. To
            remove such "stored" sequences, hold down Ctrl and Alt and
            click in the sequence.
            <br><br>
            <i>Automatic:</i> Go to the <i>De novo</i> option in the menu below the 
            spectrum and select which ion type you would like to annotate. Note that 
            this annotation only tries to find matches against the sequence identified 
            by the PSM, and as such only gives an overview over the match between the 
            sequence and the spectrum for the selected ion types. For a complete <i>de novo</i> 
            sequencing showing all options for each distance use the manual option.
